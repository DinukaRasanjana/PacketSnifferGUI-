# PacketSnifferGUI

A simple Python-based packet sniffer GUI built using **Tkinter** and **Scapy** for network monitoring. This tool captures network packets and allows for real-time analysis based on specific protocol and IP filters. Ideal for educational purposes, network diagnostics, or anyone interested in exploring network traffic.

## Features

- **Protocol Filtering**: Capture specific protocols (TCP, UDP, or All).
- **IP Filtering**: Filter packets by source or destination IP address.
- **Real-Time Packet Monitoring**: Start and stop sniffing with live updates in the GUI.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive design for easy packet analysis.
- **Multithreading**: Ensures smooth operation by running sniffing in a separate thread.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system.
- **Scapy**: A powerful Python library for network packet manipulation.
